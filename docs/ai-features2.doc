AI-Powered Killer Add-ons Implementation Plan

1. Deal Coach AI
Feature:
Click on any deal to get AI-generated next steps to improve close probability.

Where:
- Page: DealDetailPage.tsx (Deal details view)
- User Journey:
  1. User navigates to a specific deal (from DealsPage.tsx).
  2. On the deal detail page, a new section/button "AI Deal Coach" is visible.
  3. When clicked, the app sends deal data (stage, value, history, etc.) to OpenAI API (optionally via LangChain for prompt engineering).
  4. The AI returns actionable next steps, which are displayed in a card or modal.

Implementation Steps:
- Add a button or card in DealDetailPage.tsx for "AI Deal Coach".
- On click, call a backend endpoint or directly use OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-4) with deal context.
- Display the AI's suggestions in the UI.
- Optionally, store suggestions in a vector DB for future retrieval/analysis.

2. Customer Persona Builder
Feature:
AI auto-generates behavioral profiles for leads based on interaction history.

Where:
- Page: ContactDetailPage.tsx (Contact/lead details view)
- User Journey:
  1. User views a contact/lead.
  2. A "Generate Persona" button or section is available.
  3. On click, the app aggregates the contact's communication, deal, and activity history.
  4. This data is sent to OpenAI API (optionally via LangChain for prompt templating).
  5. The AI returns a persona summary (e.g., "Analytical, prefers email, price-sensitive").
  6. The persona is displayed and optionally saved for future reference.

Implementation Steps:
- Add a "Generate Persona" button/section in ContactDetailPage.tsx.
- Aggregate the contact's history (from communications, deals, notes etc.).
- Send the data to OpenAI API and display the persona.
- Optionally, store personas in a vector DB for similarity search.

3. Objection Handler Recommender
Feature:
Paste customer objection, AI suggests convincing responses.

Where:
- Page: Could be a modal or sidebar on DealDetailPage.tsx, ContactDetailPage.tsx, or in communication logging forms (CommunicationsPage.tsx, CommunicationDetailPage.tsx).
- User Journey:
  1. User clicks "Handle Objection" or "AI Objection Helper".
  2. A modal appears where the user pastes or types the customer's objection.
  3. On submit, the objection is sent to OpenAI API (optionally with deal/contact context).
  4. The AI returns a recommended response, which is shown to the user.

Implementation Steps:
- Add a modal/component for objection input.
- On submit, call OpenAI API with the objection and context.
- Display the AI's response.
- Optionally, log the objection/response for future training or retrieval.

4. Win-Loss Explainer
Feature:
AI explains why deals were won or lost based on data patterns.

Where:
- Page: DealDetailPage.tsx (for closed deals), DealsPage.tsx (summary), and optionally on the dashboard.
- User Journey:
  1. User views a closed deal (won or lost).
  2. A "Why did we win/lose?" button or section is visible.
  3. On click, the app sends deal data and related history to OpenAI API (optionally with LangChain for prompt engineering).
  4. The AI returns an explanation, which is displayed to the user.

Implementation Steps:
- Add a "Win-Loss Explainer" button/section in DealDetailPage.tsx for closed deals.
- Aggregate relevant deal and communication data.
- Send to OpenAI API and display the explanation.
- Optionally, aggregate explanations for reporting on the dashboard.

Technical Stack & Integration
- OpenAI API: For all LLM-powered features (text generation, persona, objection handling, explanations).
- LangChain (optional): For advanced prompt engineering, chaining, or retrieval-augmented generation.
- Vector DB (optional): For storing and searching AI-generated content, personas, objections, etc. (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or open-source alternatives).
- Frontend:
  - Add new UI components (buttons, modals, cards) in relevant pages.
  - Use React hooks for API calls and state management.
- Backend (if needed):
  - Create API endpoints to proxy OpenAI requests, handle security, and manage vector DB.
  - Aggregate and preprocess data for AI prompts.

Next Steps
1. Design UI components for each feature in the relevant pages.
2. Implement API integration with OpenAI (and optionally LangChain/vector DB).
3. Test user flows and iterate on prompt engineering for best results.
4. Document each feature in the user guide and onboarding.

---

Note:
- All AI features should clearly indicate to users that responses are AI-generated.
- Consider logging user feedback on AI suggestions for future improvement.

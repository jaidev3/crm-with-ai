# Deal to Purchase History Integration

## Overview

This feature automatically connects deal values with purchase history when deals are closed as "won", creating a seamless link between your sales pipeline and revenue tracking.

## How It Works

### Automatic Purchase History Creation

When a deal is moved to "closed-won" stage, the system can automatically create a purchase history record with:

- **Amount**: Deal's monetary value
- **Product/Service**: Deal title
- **Date**: Current date
- **Status**: Completed
- **Customer**: Deal's associated contact
- **Deal Reference**: Links back to the original deal

### Manual Purchase Creation Modal

For deals with contacts and monetary value > $0, when closing as won, users see a modal allowing them to:

1. **Customize Purchase Details**:

   - Adjust the purchase amount
   - Modify product/service description
   - Set purchase date
   - Choose purchase status (completed, pending, etc.)

2. **Skip Purchase Creation**:

   - Close deal without creating purchase history
   - Useful for deals that don't represent direct sales

3. **View Customer Information**:
   - See contact details before creating purchase
   - Ensure accuracy of the purchase record

## User Interface Integration

### Deals Page

- Stage dropdown automatically triggers close modal when selecting "Closed Won"
- Only shows modal for deals with contacts and monetary value

### Deal Detail Page

- "Close as Won" button appears for eligible deals
- Button only visible for deals that aren't already closed and have contact + value

### Purchase History Page

- Shows linked deals in purchase records
- Displays deal stage and title for context

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Revenue Tracking**: Every closed deal becomes a purchase record
2. **Data Consistency**: Deal values are preserved in purchase history
3. **Historical Analysis**: Better reporting on deal-to-revenue conversion
4. **Customer Journey**: Complete view from lead to purchase
5. **Flexibility**: Users can customize or skip purchase creation

## Usage Examples

1. Deal "Website Development" worth $5,000 reaches negotiation
2. User moves deal to "Closed Won"
3. Modal appears with pre-filled details
4. User confirms and creates purchase record
5. Deal is closed, purchase history created automatically

### Scenario 2: Custom Purchase Details

1. Deal "Consulting Services" worth $10,000 is ready to close
2. User clicks "Close as Won" button
3. Modal appears, user adjusts:
   - Amount to $8,500 (actual invoiced amount)
   - Product to "Q1 Consulting Package"

4. Purchase record created with custom details

### Scenario 3: Deal Without Purchase
